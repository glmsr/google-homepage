# google-homepage
	



		
		This is my own Google homepage, which is inspired by The Odin Project.

	I had chance to practice my flexbox and cssgrid knowledge in this project. And also, I've learned a lot of new things alongside such as placing the materials, adding fonts and icons, adjusting elements and theirpositions however I like. For me, there is some more details that should be added such as hovering on the searchbar and so,but I've decided to finish the project as soon as possible and go ahead learning Javascript.
